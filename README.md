# Learning Python
*A few exercises to learn Python in a fun way!*

The goal is to learn programing without those boring and silly examples. The firt time I opened an IDE was in August/2019. The ultimate goal is to be able to create web apps on my own until the end of 2019.

All exercises are proposed by my husband (@vmunhoz) and/or my cousin (@FerJSSilva). They are programers since I know them.

Let's have fun and learn!
